`poetry-udeps` is inspired by [`cargo-udeps`](https://github.com/est31/cargo-udeps) and is a tool for finding unused dependencies in a [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)-based Python project.
That is, finding unused dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.


## Install

This tool expects that you run it where you have `poetry` on your `$PATH`.

### From crates.io

```
cargo install poetry-udeps --locked
```

## Usage

This is meant to be run in the root of your Poetry project.

```
Find unused dependencies in pyproject.toml

Usage: poetry-udeps [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -v, --verbose...  More output per occurrence
  -q, --quiet...    Less output per occurrence
  -e, --virtualenv  Whether to look for dependency usage in the poetry
                    virtualenv
  -d, --dev         Whether to look for unused dependencies from
                    dev-dependencies
  -h, --help        Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version     Print version
```

## Roadmap

- Better logging. E.g., the ability to increase verbosity and see where dependencies are referenced
  as they are removed from the set.
- Ability to distinguish if deps were removed from the set by the projects deps (i.e., during the
  venv scan), or by the project itself.
- Ability to parse jupyter notebooks. This would likely introduce a dependency like jupyter to use
  `nbconvert`. Lower priority.
