`poetry-udeps` is inspired by [`cargo-udeps`](https://github.com/est31/cargo-udeps) and is a tool for finding unused dependencies in a [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)-based Python project.
That is, finding unused dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.

Python dependencies do not always map 1:1 with their package names.
Consequently, it is _likely_ that you will see false positives.
Hopefully, the list of positives is small enough for this tool to be useful, and to be easy to manually audit.

Additional name mappings can be added to [`src/name_map.rs`](src/name_map.rs) to improve accuracy.

## Install

This tool expects that you run it where you have `poetry` on your `$PATH`.

### From crates.io

```
cargo install poetry-udeps --locked
```

## Usage

This is meant to be run in the root of your Poetry project.

```
Find unused dependencies in pyproject.toml

Usage: poetry-udeps [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -v, --verbose...  More output per occurrence
  -q, --quiet...    Less output per occurrence
  -e, --virtualenv  Whether to look for dependency usage in the poetry
                    virtualenv
  -d, --dev         Whether to look for unused dependencies from
                    dev-dependencies
  -h, --help        Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version     Print version
```

## How does this work?

This is a very simple parsing approach.
That is, `poetry-udeps` doesn't interpret any Python, we just literally search through all the files in the project for import statements which match the package names (or their aliases as defined by the embedded name map).
This means it is fast!
But, it also means there are some false positives that it simply cannot detect.
For example, sqlalchemy's async sessions might depend on `asyncpg`, even though your immediate project never imports it.
To help with that (somewhat), you can use the option (`--virtualenv`) to include searching through all the Python files in your poetry environment as well.

### Benchmarks

`poetry-udeps` only checks for unused dependencies.
Below, we benchmark this single feature on a desktop with an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D and 64 GB of RAM.
The target repository is a private repository consisting of ~170k lines of Python code.
