## TODO

- Performance comparisons to deptry and pip-extra-reqs
- section for trophy case
- Better logging. E.g., the ability to increase verbosity and see where dependencies are referenced
  as they are removed from the set.
- Ability to distinguish if deps were removed from the set by the projects deps (i.e., during the
  venv scan), or by the project itself.
- Ability to parse jupyter notebooks. This would likely introduce a dependency like jupyter to use
  `nbconvert`. Lower priority.
